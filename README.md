# Write up for Topiwala Tailor

My web application is being designed for a custom tailoring shop. I am creating a landing page for Topiwala Tailor. Custom tailoring aims to give customers full control over their choice of material and style for clothing made custom fitted to their size. In my Topiwala Tailor application, I am using authentic images of clothing that was made for customers.

The main purpose of the app is to draw in online consumers so they can visit the Topiwala Tailor page. There is Topiwala Tailor’s logo on the navigation bar to help brand the app. On the main page, there is a slogan for the shop which is used to entice customers to keep scrolling. There is also information on what Topiwala Tailor does and the hours of operation. Specialty clothing targeted to a specific niche within the Parsi community is also included on the main page. Potential customers that are not familiar with Topiwala Tailor can scroll to see popular products organized into product categories along with product pictures and price range estimates. If the customer is interested, she or he can book an appointment online using their e-mail. If a customer wants to create an account, they can sign up. If a customer already has an account, they can login to check the status of their orders. At the bottom of the page there is a footer which includes different ways of contacting Topiwala Tailor and the location of the business.

Topiwala Tailor has been serving customers for over 30 years. With the development of the app, and the millions of online consumers, Topiwala Tailor is looking to expand its customer base and give its customers an easy way to interact with them for their orders.
